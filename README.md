# Movie Reviews Sentiment Analysis
This NLP project is aimed at understanding the sentiment of movie reviews.
The Large Movie Review Dataset which contains 50,000 training examples is used for this project. Since sentiments are usually bipolar (love/hate, like/dislike), if a review gives a rating of more than 5, then it is considered as a positive review, else negative.
